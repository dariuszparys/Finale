# Finale

This is a sample for the [XPCon](http://xpcon.de). It is based on the prototype of [Emanuele Feronato's](http://www.emanueleferonato.com/) One Touch RPG simple rewrite. The goal is to win with Germany the European Championship final 2016 against France. Don't know why I forecast this final, we'll see how the tournament ends.

## Things you could do from here

- Implement team selection
- Implement tournament mode
- Implement overtime
- Implement shopping system or ad based award system to retrieve some extra tries
- etc...
